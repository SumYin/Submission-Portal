I want you to look at these features and help me design a sqlite third normalized data base, here is some info on how I want to have the files sorted. so edit the form creation page, form edit page, and sumbit page to match.

You are allowed to one of the four options, Videos, Pictures, Audio, Others (text, zip, etc)

For all there will be a min/max file size. but the max file size will be capped at 100mb anyways.

For videos, pictures, and audio I'll need you to have constraints of min/max, types of file (.png vs .jpg vs tff vs webmp) or something so you don't need to do all images or images or audio files.

Then for each of the tree custom constriants would be like min/max frame rate, reslution(width and height), frame rate, number of frames or length (use one),

All constraints needs to be able to be detected either native python or ffmpeg and reliably(either ALL files WILL have to have it or like it's currupted which we can return that and a warning or smth).

Remember when editing the form that interface must match the creation one(same everything so all things can be changed)

make it so it's a guided creation process, where you are asked which type of file, once clicked it will then move you onto the next page with only the settings for that kind of file. for the other files section just make it where you are allowed to enter allowed files as like a list of .wtv and then we can store that into SQL(is this possible under third normalization?)

For file size make it MB and max is 100MB
